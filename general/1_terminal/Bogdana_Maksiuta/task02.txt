How I see this, the script is run in a subshell (child shell). 
Changing the current directory in a subshell doesn't change the working directory in the parent shell. 
Its effects are lost when the script finishes.
The script can also start another child's process in its own subshell. 
This allows scripts to parallelize data processing across multiple tasks running at the same time.
So, this behavior helps us to avoid different types of conflicts.
