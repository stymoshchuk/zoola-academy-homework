Shells (Terminal) and shell-scripts always point to some dir on file system.â€©Terminal that point to Shell and shell-script are diferent process with their own process directories. Shell is a parent process and shell-script is child process, because it is executed from parent Shell process. So when you cd in some directory from shell-script, the directory is changed in the child process only - in shell-script! So when shell-script end its execution and terminates, you get back to the Shell (Terminal) and his (Shell) process directory has not changed and stay at the same directory where it was befor the shell-script execution call.
